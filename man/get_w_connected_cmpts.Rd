\title{Get all nodes associated with connected components}
\usage{
get_w_connected_cmpts(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{a graph object of class
\code{dgr_graph} that is created using
\code{create_graph}.}
}
\value{
a data frame with nodes and their membership
in different weakly connected components.
}
\description{
Determine which nodes in a graph belong
to different connected components (i.e., distinct
sets of nodes with traversable paths to and from
each node in the set).
}
\examples{
# Create a random graph
graph <-
  create_random_graph(36, 50, set_seed = 1)

# Check if the graph is connected
is_graph_connected(graph)
#> [1] TRUE

# Modify the graph so that it becomes disconnected
# (with two clusters of nodes)
