\title{Create a randomized graph}
\usage{
create_random_graph(n, m, directed = FALSE, fully_connected = FALSE,
  display_labels = TRUE, set_seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of nodes to use in the
random graph.}

\item{m}{the number of edges to use in the
random graph.}

\item{directed}{an option for whether the random
graph should be undirected (default) or directed.}

\item{fully_connected}{should the graph be fully
connected (i.e., no free nodes).}

\item{display_labels}{display node labels.}

\item{set_seed}{supplying a value sets a random seed
of the \code{Mersenne-Twister} implementation.}
}
\description{
Create a graph of up to \code{n} nodes
with randomized edge assignments.

\examples{
# Create a random, directed graph with 50 nodes
# and 75 edges
random_graph_directed <-
  create_random_graph(
    n = 50,
    m = 75,
    directed = TRUE)

# Create a random, undirected graph that's
# fully connected
random_graph_undirected <-
  create_random_graph(
    n = 30,
    m = 30,
    fully_connected = TRUE)

# Create a directed graph with a seed set so that
# it's reproducible
directed_graph <-
  create_random_graph(
    n = 15,
    m = 34,
    set_seed = 50)
